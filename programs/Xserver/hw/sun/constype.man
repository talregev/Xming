.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "constype"
[
.I device_name
] [
.B \-num
]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B constype
prints on the standard output the Sun code for the type of display
that the specified device is.
The types output include these:
.sp 2
.in +0.5i
.nf
bw?	Black and White, where ? is 1-4. (eg) 3-50s are bw2

gp?	Optional Graphics Processor board, where ? is 1-2
ns?	Not Sun display \(em where ? is A-J
.fi
.in -0.5i
.sp 2
If the OS and device support the VIS_GETIDENTIFIER ioctl, the value
returned from the ioctl is the value printed by constype.   Sample types
output for these include:
.sp 2
.in +0.5i
.nf
SUNWffb        Sun Creator 3D (ffb) Graphics Accelerator
SUNWm64        Sun PGX8, PGX24 or PGX64 Frame Buffer
SUNWtext       Generic vgatext console for Solaris x86 graphics devices without specific kernel drivers
.fi
.in -0.5i
.sp 2
This is useful in determining startup values and defaults for window
systems.
.LP
The
.I device_name
argument, if given, is the device to examine.
If not given,
.I /dev/fb
is used.
.LP
The
.B \-num
option causes
.I constype
to follow the type keyword with the numeric value of that type,
as returned by the FBIOGATTR or FBIOGTYPE ioctl and defined in fbio.h.
This is useful if the type is not recognized by the program.
.SH "EXIT STATUS"
The program exits with status 0 if it identified a known console type,
1 if the type was unknown, and 2 if the device could not be opened or
another error occurred.
.SH BUGS
Not tested on all frame buffer types
