1.  Supported Hardware

This is an unaccelerated driver for the SGI newport cards (a.k.a. XL) as
found in the SGI Indy and Indigo2. Both the 8bit and 24bit versions are
tested and working.

2.  Features

   o Support for 8 and 24 bit pixel depths

   o Hardware cursor support to reduce flicker

3.  Notes

   o X -configure does not generate a xorg.conf file.

   o There's only a 1280x1024 mode.

4.  Configuration

The driver auto-detects all device information necessary to initialize the
card on the Indy. The only lines you need in the "Device" section of your
xorg.conf file are:

            Section "Device"
                Identifier "SGI newport"
                Driver     "newport"
            EndSection

Indigo2 users have to use the BusID option as documented below.

However, if you have problems with auto-detection, you can specify:

   o bitplanes - number of physical bitplanes (8 or 24)

   o HWCursor - enable or disable hardware cursor

   o BusID - set this to "1" on the Indigo2 XL
