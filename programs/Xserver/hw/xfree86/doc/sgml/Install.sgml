How to install the X.Org Foundation's X Window System release version
X11R&relvers;.

<sect>Introduction
<p>
At this time, the X.Org Foundation is not making binary releases; this
will likely change in the future as our tinderbox system reaches its
full potential.
<p>
However, people are already packaging the distribution for release in
many of the common distributions (e.g., Fedora Core, SuSE Linux,
Debian), and you may wish to work with those distributors on their
packaged binaries.
<p>
In the meanwhile, we recommend building X from source and doing an
install on top of your running X installation *after* having carefully
backed up /usr/X11R6 to allow restoration in case of some unanticipated
problems.  See the file INSTALL.TXT in the root of the source
distribution for build and install details.
