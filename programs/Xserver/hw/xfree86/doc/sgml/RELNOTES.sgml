<title>Release Notes for X11R&relvers; and X11R&modvers;
<author>The X.Org Foundation
<and>The XFree86 Project, Inc.
<date>&reldate;

<abstract>

These release notes contains information about features and their status
in the X.Org Foundation X11R&relvers;/X11R&modvers; release.  It is
based on the XFree86 4.4RC2 RELNOTES document published by The
XFree86&trade; Project, Inc.  There are significant updates and
differences in the X.Org release as noted below.

</abstract>

<toc>

<p>
<sect>Introduction to the X11R&relvers;/X11R&modvers; Release
<p>
This release constitutes the first major version release of the X Window
System in over a decade.  The main reasons for the major version bump
from 6 to 7 is that we have moved from what has traditionally been a
source codebase comprised of many different components brought together
into a single monolithic tree to a source codebase where each of those
same components found in the monolithic tree are now split into logical
modules that can be developed, built and maintained separately, but
still fit together coherently into the larger project.  At the same
time, we have moved away from the imake build system to an autotools
build system.  By making these changes we have opened the source code up
to a new generation of developers that can continue to build upon the
long tradition of the X Window System.
<p>
The reason for having simultaneous releases for both the monolithic and
modular trees is to allow for a transition period as developers,
builders and vendors incorporate the significant changes to how the tree
is built and developed into their products and to allow time for
additional platforms to be supported the modular tree.  This initial
modular release has support for Linux and Solaris.  During the
transition period, we expect both the monolithic and modular trees to
coexist.  For the monolithic tree, we expect that there will be
maintenance releases in the X11R6.8.x and X11R6.9.x series as needed.
However, the main development effort will move over to the new modular
tree.
<p>
The X11R&modvers; release is the first in the modular series.  One of
the advantages of the modular tree is that it allows for more rapid and
independent updates of module components, so full maintenance releases
will no longer be required for simple bug fixes.  Rather, each module
component maintainer can prepare new releases as needed.  These module
component releases will then be periodically "rolled up" into official
X.Org Foundation releases.  The next official release will be
X11R&nextrelvers; and is expected in &nextfullreldate;.
<p>
For more information on the modularization effort see the <url
name="Modularization Proposal"
url="http://wiki.x.org/wiki/ModularizationProposal">, and for help with
how to build and develop in the new modular tree see <url name="Modular
Developer's Guide" url="http://wiki.x.org/wiki/ModularDevelopersGuide">.
<p>
We encourage you to submit bug fixes and enhancements to
freedesktop.org's <url name="bug tracking system"
url="https://bugs.freedesktop.org/"> using the xorg product, and to
discuss them on <email>xorg@lists.freedesktop.org</email>.
<p>
The release numbering is based on the original MIT X numbering system.
X11 refers to the version of the network protocol that the X Window
system is based on: Version 11 was first released in 1988 and has been
stable for 17 years, with only upward compatible additions to the core X
protocol, a record of stability envied in computing.  Formal releases of
X started with X version 9 from MIT; the first commercial X products
were based on X version 10.  The MIT X Consortium and its successors,
the X Consortium, the Open Group X Project Team, and the X.Org Group
released versions X11R3 through X11R6.6, before the founding of the
X.Org Foundation in early 2004.

<P>
This is a sampling of the new features in X11R&relvers;/X11R&modvers;.
A more complete list of changes can be found in the ChangeLog file that
is part of the X source tree.

<itemize>

<item>EXA support included

EXA is a new accleration architecture to replace XAA, the current
architecture.  It is largely based upon KAA in KDrive, and is far more
efficient at accelerating typical workloads on modern hardware,
particularly involving the RENDER extension.

<item>FreeType was updated to version 2.1.9. But installing FreeType
from X distributions would often or usually result in the replacement
or use of "stale" versions of FreeType. On Linux, FreeBSD, Solaris 10,
and SCO5, therefore, X11R&relvers; will by default use the version
of FreeType2 that is installed on the system. If your system doesn't
come with an installed FreeType2 and you wish to use the version
supplied with this distribution, please add:

  #define HasFreetype2 NO 

to config/cf/host.def.

<item>Updated Mesa and DRI from upstream sources

<item>CAN-2005-2495 security fixes

<item>Shared libraries now built for libXau and libXdmcp

<item>GNU/kFreeBSD support

</itemize>

<sect1>Updated keyboard mappings
<p>
The requirement for XKB data can, in the modular tree, be satisfied either
by the traditional data set (the 'xkbdata' module), or by the dataset from
the xkeyboard-config project (the 'xkbdesc' module).  xkbdesc has numerous
improvements relative to xkbdata: layouts have been cleaned up for
consistency and universal multi-layout support, some new layouts have added,
and some layouts have changed names to be more straightforward and ISO
compliant.  Some setups will need adjustments in order to use xkbdesc.

<sect1>New loader mechanism
<p>
The loader now uses the standard libdl-based loader, instead of
implementing its own ELF loading and parsing mechanism.  This extends loadable
server support to many platforms where it was not previously possible, such
as MIPS, Motorola 68000, HP PA/RISC, et al.  The core loader itself has also
been significantly optimised.

<sect>Overview of X11R&relvers; and X11R&modvers;
<p>
On most platforms, X11R&relvers;/X11R&modvers; has a single X server
binary called <tt>Xorg</tt>.  This binary can either have one or more
video and input drivers linked in statically, or more usually,
dynamically, and in that manner load the video drivers, input drivers,
and other modules that are needed.

X11R&relvers; has X server support for most UNIX&reg; and UNIX-like
operating systems on Intel/x86 platforms, plus support for Linux and
some BSD OSs on Alpha, PowerPC, IA-64, AMD64, Sparc, and Mips platforms,
and for Darwin on PowerPC.  X11R&modvers; has X server currently has
support for Linux and Solaris, and is expected to have other platform
support in X11R&nextrelvers;.

<sect1>Loader and Modules
<p>
The X server has a built-in run-time loader, which can load
normal object files and libraries in most of the commonly used formats.
The loader does not rely on an operating system's native dynamic
loader support and it works on platforms that do not provide this feature.
This  allows  for the modules to be operating system independent (although
not, of course, CPU architecture independent) which means that a module
compiled on Linux/x86 can be loaded by an X server running on Solaris/x86,
or FreeBSD, or even OS/2.

A main benefit of this, is that when modules are updated, they do not
need to be recompiled for every different operating system.  The loader
in version &relvers;/&modvers; has support for Intel (x86), Alpha and
PowerPC platforms.  It also has preliminary support for Sparc platforms.

The X server makes use of modules for video drivers, X server extensions,
font rasterisers, input device drivers, framebuffer layers (like mfb,
cfb, etc), and internal components used by some drivers (like XAA),

The module interfaces (both API and ABI) used in this release are subject
to change without notice.  While we will attempt to provide backward
compatibility for the module interfaces as of the 4.0 release (meaning
that 4.0 modules will work with future core X server binaries), we cannot
guarantee this.  Compatibility in the other direction is explicitly
not guaranteed because new modules may rely on interfaces added in new
releases.

<bf>Note about module security</bf>
<quote>
	The X server runs with root privileges, i.e., 
	the X server loadable modules also run with these privileges.
	For this reason we recommend that all users be careful to only
	use loadable modules from reliable sources,  otherwise the
	introduction of viruses and contaminated code can occur and
	wreak havoc on your system.  We hope to have a mechanism for
	signing/verifying the modules that we provide available in a
	future release.
</quote>

<sect1>Configuration File <label id="config">
<p>

The X server uses a configuration file as the primary mechanism
for providing configuration and run-time parameters.  The configuration
file format is described in detail in the <htmlurl name="xorg.conf(5)"
url="xorg.conf.5.html"> manual page.

This release comes with a graphical configuration tool called
"<tt>xorgcfg</tt>", which also has a text mode interface and can be used
to create an initial configuration file. It can also be used to
customise existing configurations.

Next in the order of configuration preferences is to use the Xorg
server's ability to create a starting configuration file.  Run as root:
<tscreen><verb>Xorg -configure</verb></tscreen> and follow the instructions.

Finally, if all else fails, the trusty old standby text-based tool
"<tt>xorgconfig</tt>" can also be used for generating X server config
files.

At least one, and hopefully, all of these configuration options will
give you a reasonable starting point for a suitable configuration
file.  With the automatic mechanism you might even find that you don't
need one!  

If you do need to customize the configuration file, see the <htmlurl
name="xorg.conf manual page" url="xorg.conf.5.html">.  You can also
check the driver-specific manual pages and the related documentation
(found at <ref id="drivertables" name="tables below"> also.

<sect1>Command Line Options
<p>

Command line options can be used to override some default parameters and
parameters provided in the configuration file.  These command line options
are described in the <htmlurl name="Xorg(1)"
url="Xorg.1.html"> manual page.
  
<sect1>XAA
<p>

The XFree86 Acceleration Architecture (XAA) was completely rewritten
from scratch for XFree86 4.x and is used in X11R&relvers;/X11R&modvers;.  
Most drivers implement acceleration by
making use of the XAA module.
The Xorg server will accept modules built either for XFree86 4.4
servers or its own.

<sect1>Multi-head
<p>
Some multi-head configurations are supported in 
X11R&relvers;/X11R&modvers;, primarily with multiple PCI/AGP cards.

One of the main problems is with drivers not sufficiently initialising
cards that were not initialised at boot time.  This has been improved
somewhat with the INT10 support that is used by most drivers (which
allows secondary card to be "soft-booted", but in some cases there are
other issues that still need to be resolved.  Some combinations can be
made to work better by changing which card is the primary card (either
by using a different PCI slot, or by changing the system BIOS's preference
for the primary card).

<sect1>Xinerama
<p>
Xinerama is an X server extension that allows multiple physical screens
to behave as a single screen.  With traditional multi-head in X11,
windows cannot span or cross physical screens.  Xinerama removes this
limitation.  Xinerama does, however, require that the physical screens
all have the same root depth, so it isn't possible, for example, to use
an 8-bit screen together with a 16-bit screen in Xinerama mode.

Xinerama is not enabled by default, and can be enabled with the
<tt>+xinerama</tt> command line option for the X server.

Xinerama was included with X11R6.4.  The version included in
X11R&relvers;/X11R&modvers; was completely rewritten for improved
performance and correctness.

Known problems:
<itemize>
  <item>Most window managers are not Xinerama-aware, and so some
	operations like window placement and resizing might not behave
	in an ideal way.  This is an issue that needs to be dealt with
	in the individual window managers, and isn't specifically an
	X server problem.

</itemize>

<sect1>DGA version 2
<p>

DGA 2.0 is included in &relvers;/&modvers;.
Documentation for the client libraries can be found in the <htmlurl
name="XDGA(3)" url="XDGA.3.man"> man page.  A good degree of backwards
compatibility with version 1.0 is provided.


<sect1>DDC
<p>
The VESA&reg; Display Data Channel (DDC&trade;) standard allows the monitor
to tell the video card (or on some cases the computer directly) about
itself; particularly the supported screen resolutions and refresh rates.

Partial or complete DDC support is available in most of the video drivers.
DDC is enabled by default, but can be disabled with a "Device" section
entry:  <tt>Option "NoDDC"</tt>.  We have support for DDC versions 1
and 2; these can be disabled independently with <tt>Option "NoDDC1"</tt>
and <tt>Option "NoDDC2"</tt>.

At startup the server prints out DDC information from the display, and
can use this information to set the default monitor parameters, or to
warn about monitor sync limits if those provided in the configuration file
don't match those that are detected.

<sect2>Changed behavior caused by DDC.
<p>
Several drivers uses DDC information to
set the screen size and pitch.  This can be overridden by explicitly
resetting it to the and non-DDC default value 75 with the <tt>-dpi
75</tt> command line option for the X server, or by specifying appropriate
screen dimensions with the "DisplaySize" keyword in the "Monitor" section
of the config file.


<sect1>GLX and the Direct Rendering Infrastructure (DRI)
<p>

Direct rendered OpenGL&reg; support is provided for several hardware
platforms by the Direct Rendering Infrastructure (DRI).  Further information
about DRI can be found at the <url name="DRI Project's web site"
url="http://dri.sf.net/">.  The 3D core rendering component is provided by
<url name="Mesa" url="http://www.mesa3d.org">.

<sect1>XVideo Extension (Xv)
<p>

The XVideo extension is supported in X11R6.7.x.
An XvQueryPortAttributes function has been added as well as
support for XvImages.  XvImages are XImages in alternate color spaces 
such as YUV and can be passed to the server through shared memory
segments.  This allows clients to display YUV data with high quality
hardware scaling and filtering.

<sect1>X Rendering Extension (Render) <label id="render">
<p>

The X Rendering extension provides a 2D rendering model that more
closely matches application demands and hardware capabilities.  It provides
a rendering model derived from Plan 9 based on Porter/Duff image
composition rather than binary raster operations.

<p>
Using simple compositing operators provided by most hardware, Render
can draw anti-aliased text and geometric objects as well as perform 
translucent image overlays and other image operations not possible with 
the core X rendering system.

<p>
Unlike the core protocol, Render provides no font support for applications,
rather it allows applications to upload glyphs for display on the screen.
This allows the client greater control over text rendering and complete
access to the available font information while still providing hardware
acceleration.  The Xft library provides font access for
Render applications.
	
<sect2>The Xft Library
<p>

On the client side, the Xft library provides access to fonts for
applications using the FreeType library, version 2.  One 
important thing to note is that Xft uses the vertical size of the monitor 
to compute accurate pixel sizes for provided point sizes; if your monitor 
doesn't provide accurate information via DDC, you may want to add that 
information to <tt>xorg.conf</tt>.

<p>

To allow a graceful transition for applications moving from core text
rendering to the Render extension, Xft can use either the core rendering
requests or the Render extension for text.  
See the section on FreeType support in Xft for instructions on
configuring X11R&relvers;/X11R&modvers; to use an existing FreeType
installation.

<p>
The Xft library uses configuration files, <tt>/etc/fonts/fonts.conf</tt>
and <tt>/etc/fonts/local.conf</tt>, which
contains information about which directories contain font files and also
provides a sophisticated font aliasing mechanism.  Documentation for that
file is included in the <htmlurl name="Xft(3)" url="Xft.3.man"> man page.

</sect2>

<sect2>Application Support For Anti-Aliased Text
<p>

Only four applications have been modified in X11R&relvers;/X11R&modvers;
to work with the Render extension and the Xft and FreeType libraries to
provide anti-aliased text: xterm, xditview, x11perf and xclock.
Migration of other applications may occur in future releases.

<p>
By default, xterm uses core fonts through the standard core API.  It has
a command line option and associated resource to direct it to use
Xft instead:
<itemize>
  <item><tt>-fa</tt> family / <tt>.VT100.faceName:</tt> family.  Selects the 
	font family to use.
</itemize>

<p>
Xditview will use Xft instead of the core API by default.  X11perf 
includes tests to measure the performance of text rendered in three ways, 
anti-aliased, anti-aliased with sub-pixel sampling and regular chunky 
text, but through the Render extension, a path which is currently somewhat
slower than core text.
<p>
Xclock uses the Render extension to draw the analog face and shares the -fa
option and faceName resources with xterm to select a font for the digital
mode.
</sect2>

<sect1>Other extensions
<p>

The XFree86-Misc extension has not been fully ported to the new server
architecture yet.  This should be completed in a future release.

The XFree86-VidModeExtension extension has been updated, and mostly ported
to the new server architecture.  The area of mode validation needs further
work, and the extension should be used with care.  This extension has
support for changing the gamma setting at run-time, for modes where this
is possible.  The <tt>xgamma</tt> utility makes use of this feature.
Compatibility with the 3.3.x version of the extension is provided.
The missing parts of this extension and some new features should be
completed in a future release.


<!--
<sect>X libraries and clients
<p>

<sect1>xedit
<p>

Xedit has several new features, including:
<itemize>
  <item>An embedded lisp interpreter that allows easier extension of the editor.
  <item>Several new syntax highlight modes, and indentation rules for C and Lisp.
  <item>Flexible search/replace interface that allows regex matches.
  <item>Please refer to <tt><htmlurl name="xedit(1)" url="xedit.1.html"></tt>

<!--
<sect>Fonts and Internationalisation

<sect1>Font support
<p>

Details about the font support in X11R&relvers;.x/X11R&modvers;.x can be
found in the <htmlurl name="README.fonts" url="fonts.html"> document.

<sect1>TrueType support
<p>

X11R6.7 came with two TrueType backends.  The functionality from the
`X-TrueType' backend has been integrated into the `FreeType' backend which
is designed to transparently support all of the functionality from the
`X-TrueType' backend with the exception of the font encoding libraries; the
`FreeType' backend uses only the fontenc-based encoding system .

<sect1>CID font support
<p>

Support for CID-keyed fonts is included in X11R&relvers;/X11R&modvers;
The CID-keyed font format was designed by <url name="Adobe Systems"
url="http://www.adobe.com"> for fonts with large character sets.  The
CID-keyed font support in X11R&relvers;/X11R&modvers; was donated by
<url name="SGI" url="http://www.sgi.com">.  See the <htmlurl
name="LICENSE" url="LICENSE.html"> document for a copy of the CID Font
Code Public License.

<sect1>Internationalisation of the scalable font backends
<p>

X11R&relvers;/X11R&modvers; has a ``fontenc'' layer to allow the
scalable font backends to use a common method of font re-encoding.  This
re-encoding makes it possible to uses fonts in encodings other than
their their native encoding.  This layer is used by the Type1 and
FreeType backends.

<sect1>Large font optimisation
<p>

The glyph metrics array, which all the X clients using a particular font
have access to, is placed in shared memory, so as to reduce redundant
memory consumption.  For non-local clients, the glyph metrics array is
transmitted in a compressed format.

<sect1>Unicode/ISO 10646 support
<p>
What is included in X11R&relvers;/X11R&modvers;

<itemize>
  <item>All ``-misc-fixed-*'' BDF fonts are now available in the
        ISO10646-1 encoding and cover at least the 614 characters
        found in ISO 8859-{1-5,7-10,14,15}, CP1252, and MES-1. The
        non-bold fonts also cover all Windows Glyph List 4 (WGL4)
        characters, including those found in all 8-bit MS-DOS/Windows
        code pages. The 8-bit variants of the ``-misc-fixed-*'' BDF
        fonts (ISO8859-1, ISO8859-2, KOI8-R, etc.) have all been
        automatically generated from the new ISO10646-1 master fonts.

  <item>Some ``-misc-fixed-*'' BDF ISO10646-1 fonts now cover a
        comprehensive Unicode repertoire of over 3000 characters
        including all Latin, Greek, Cyrillic, Armenian, Gregorian,
        Hebrew, IPA, and APL characters, plus numerous scientific,
	typographic, technical, and backwards-compatibility
        symbols. Some of these fonts also cover Arabic, Ethiopian,
        Thai, Han/Kanji, Hangul, full ISO 8859, and more. For the 6x13
        font there is now a 12x13ja Kanji extension and for the 9x18
        font there is a 18x18ja Kanji/Han/Hangul extension, which
        covers all ISO-2022-JP-2 (RFC 1554) characters. The 9x18 font
        can also be used to implement simple combining characters by
        accent overstriking. For more information, read Markus Kuhn's
        <url name="UTF-8 and Unicode FAQ"
        url="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~mgk25/unicode.html">.

  <item>Mark Leisher's ClearlyU proportional font (similar to Computer
	Modern).

  <item>ISO 10646/Unicode UTF-8 Level 1 support added to xterm
	(enabled with the <tt>-u8</tt> option).

  <item>The Freetype backend (the <tt>"freetype"</tt> module) supports
	Unicode-encoded fonts.

</itemize>

<sect1>Xlib Compose file support and extensions <label id="compose">
<p>

A more flexible Compose file processing system was added to Xlib in
X11R&relvers;/X11R&modvers;.  The compose file is searched for in 
the following order:

<enum>
<item>If the environment variable <bf>$XCOMPOSEFILE</bf> is set, its value
is used as the name of the Compose file.

<item>If the user's home directory has a file named "<tt>.XCompose</tt>", it
is used as the Compose file.

<item>The old method is used, and the compose file is
"&lt;<it>xlocaledir</it>&gt;<tt>/</tt>&lt;<it>localename</it>&gt;<tt>/Compose</tt>".

</enum>

Compose files can now use an "include" instruction.  This allows local
modifications to be made to existing compose files without including all
of the content directly.  For example, the system's iso8859-1 compose file
can be included with a line like this:
<tscreen><verb>include "/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/locale/iso8859-1/Compose"</verb></tscreen>There 
are two substitutions that can be made in the file name of the
include instruction.  <bf>%H</bf> expands to the user's home directory
(the <bf>$HOME</bf> environment variable), and <bf>%L</bf> expands to the
name of the locale specific Compose file (i.e., 
"&lt;<it>xlocaledir</it>&gt;<tt>/</tt>&lt;<it>localename</it>&gt;<tt>/Compose</tt>").

For example, you can include in your compose file the default Compose file
by using:
<tscreen><verb>include "%L"</verb></tscreen>and 
then rewrite only the few rules that you need to change.  New compose
rules can be added, and previous ones replaced.

Finally, it is no longer necessary to specify in the right part of a rule
a locale encoded string in addition to the keysym name.  If the string is
omitted, Xlib figures it out from the keysym according to the current
locale.  I.e., if a rule looks like:
<tscreen><verb><dead_grave> <A> : "\300" Agrave</verb></tscreen>the 
result of the composition is always the letter with the "\300" code.
But if the rule is:
<tscreen><verb><dead_grave> <A> : Agrave</verb></tscreen>the
result depends on how Agrave is mapped in the current locale.

<sect1>Bitstream Vera fonts <label id="vera">
<p>

X11R&relvers; includes the Bitstream Vera family of typefaces in TrueType
format.  This family includes the ``Bitstream Vera Sans'', ``Bitstream
Vera Sans Mono'' and ``Bitstream Vera Serif'' in Roman and Bold varients
as well as the ``Bitstream Vera Sans'' and ``Bitstream Vera Sans Mono''
in Oblique and Bold Oblique.
These fonts include all of the glyphs needed for ISO&nbsp; 8859 parts 1 9
and 15.

The license terms for the Vera fonts are inclued in the file
<tt/COPYRIGHT.Vera/>.

<sect1>Luxi fonts from Bigelow and Holmes <label id="luxi">
<p>

The X distribution includes the ``Luxi'' family of Type&nbsp;1 fonts and 
TrueType
fonts.  This family consists of the fonts ``Luxi&nbsp;Serif'',
``Luxi&nbsp;Sans'' and ``Luxi&nbsp;Mono'' in Roman, oblique, bold and
bold oblique variants.  The TrueType version have glyphs covering the
basic ASCII Unicode range, the Latin&nbsp;1 range, as well as the
<it/Extended Latin/ range and some additional punctuation characters.
In particular, these fonts include all the glyphs needed for ISO&nbsp;8859
parts 1, 2, 3, 4, 9, 13 and 15, as well as all the glyphs in the Adobe
Standard encoding and the Windows 3.1  character set.

The glyph coverage of the Type&nbsp;1 versions is somewhat reduced,
and only covers ISO&nbsp;8859 parts 1, 2 and 15 as well as the Adobe
Standard encoding.

The Luxi fonts are original designs by Kris Holmes and Charles Bigelow
from Bigelow and Holmes Inc., who developed the Luxi typeface designs
in Ikarus digital format.  URW++ Design and Development GmbH converted
the Ikarus format fonts to TrueType and Type&nbsp;1 font programs and
implemented the grid-fitting "hints" and kerning tables in the Luxi
fonts.

The license terms for the Luxi fonts are included in the file
`<tt/COPYRIGHT.BH/', as well as in the <htmlurl

<sect>Miscellaneous
<p>
This section describes other items of note for the
X11R&relvers;/X11R&modvers; release.

<sect1>Legacy keyboard driver phase-out
<p>
The legacy keyboard driver is no longer compiled into the X server by
default on certain platforms (including Linux).  The newer <tt>kbd</tt>
driver replaces the older built-in driver.  It is suggested that, if the
X server says that it cannot load the keyboard driver, then the
<tt>xorg.conf</tt> file should be updated to use the new <tt>kbd</tt>
driver, which can be done by changing the <tt>Driver</tt> line in the
<tt>InputDevice</tt> section.  For example,

<verb>
Section "InputDevice"
        Identifier  "Keyboard0"
        Driver      "kbd"
EndSection
</verb>
Note that the driver name is case-sensitive.

<sect1>Socket directory ownership and permissions
<p>
The socket directories created in <tt>/tmp</tt> are now required to be
owned by root and have their sticky-bit set.  If the permissions are not
set correctly, the component using this directory will print an error
message and fail to start.  Common socket directories that are known to
be affected include:
<verb>
/tmp/.font-unix
/tmp/.ICE-unix
/tmp/.X11-unix
</verb>
These directories are used by the font server, <tt>xfs</tt>,
applications using the Inter-Client Exchange protocol (ICE) and the X
server, respectively.
<p>
There are several solutions to the problem of when to create these
directories.  They could be created at install time by the system's
installer if the <tt>/tmp</tt> dir is persistent.  They could be created
at boot time by the system's boot scripts (e.g., the <tt>init.d</tt>
scripts).  Or, they could be created by PAM modules at service startup
or user login time.
<p>
The solution chosen is platform dependent, and the system administrator
should be able to handle creating those directories on any systems that
do not have the correct ownership or permissions.

<sect1>Composite exposes extra visuals
<p>
When the Composite extension is enabled via <tt>xorg.conf</tt> or the
command line, a new visual is created.  This visual is different from
the other visuals used by X applications in that it includes an alpha
component.  It is used by the compositing manager and other Composite
aware applications.
<p>
Most X applications ignore this visual since it is not useful to them;
however some applications mistakenly try to use it, which will cause
them to fail.  An environment variable, <tt>XLIB_SKIP_ARGB_VISUALS</tt>,
was added to the X11 library to hide this visual from applications that
mistakenly try to use it.  If an application fails only when the
Composite is enabled, try setting this environment variable before
starting the application.
<p>
Since Composite is not enabled by default, it is not expected that this
issue will be visible to most users.

<sect>Deprecated components and removal plans

<p>
This section lists current plans for removal of obsolete or deprecated
components in the X.Org releases.  As our releases are open source,
users who continue to require these can find the source in previous
releases and continue to use these, but the X.Org Foundation and its
volunteers have decided the burden of continued maintenance and
distribution in the core X11 releases outweighs the benefits of doing
so.  In some cases, this is simply because no one has volunteered to do
continued maintenance, so if software is listed here that you need, you
can contact <email>xorg@lists.freedesktop.org</email> to volunteer to
take over maintainership, either inside or outside of the Xorg release
process.

<descrip>
<tag>Display Postscript (DPS)</tag>

The DPS software is included and built by default (except as noted in
README.dps) in the X.Org X11R6.8 release series.  The software will be
included, but not built unless specifically configured by the builder,
in the X.Org X11R6.9 release series.  At this time, X.Org does not
plan to include any of the DPS software in X11R7.0 or later releases.
For more information, see
xc/programs/Xserver/hw/xfree86/doc/README.dps in the X.Org source
release.
