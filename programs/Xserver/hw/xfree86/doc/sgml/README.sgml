<abstract>

X11R&relvers; and X11R&modvers; are Open Source versions of the X Window
System that supports many UNIX(R) and UNIX-like operating systems (such
as Linux, FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD and Solaris x86) on Intel and other
platforms.  This version is compatible with X11R&prevrelvers; and other
X window system implementations which support the X11R&majorvers;
standard.

<toc>

<sect>What are X11R&relvers; and X11R&modvers;?
<p>
<![ %updaterel [
X11R&relvers; is the &whichupdaterel; update to X11R&majorvers;,
the &whichfullrel; full release in the
<![ %earlyrel; [new]]>
X11R&relvers; series.

Update releases are taken from a stable/maintenance branch.  They are
designed to be installed on top of the full release that they are
updating.  They contain fixes for serious problems, most commonly
fixes for security issues, fixes for driver bugs, and fixes that improve
stability.
]]>

<![ %fullrel [
X11R&relvers; is the &whichfullrel; and final full release in the
<![ %earlyrel; [new]]>
X11R&majorvers; series, and X11R&modvers; is the first release in the
new X11R&modmajor; series.
]]>

<![ %snapshot [
X11R&relvers; is a pre-release snapshot of X11R&fullrelvers;.
<![ %relcandidate [
This snapshot is release candidate &rcnum; for version &fullrelvers;.
]]>
Pre-release snapshots are provided for beta testing.  You should only install
snapshots if you're comfortable dealing with possibly unstable beta-level
software.  If you find problems with this snapshot, you are encouraged
to report your findings to the public X.Org server mailing list:
<email>xorg@lists.freedesktop.org</email>.

<![ %fullrel [The &relvers; version is a new release that includes
additional hardware support, functional enhancements and bug fixes.]]>
The &modvers; version is built from the same source code as the
&relvers; so it contains the same additional hardware support,
functional enhancements and bug fixes; however, it has been split into
logical modules that can be developed, built and maintained separately,
but still fit together coherently into the larger source code base as
they have in the &relvers; tree.
<![ %haverelnotes [
Specific release enhancements can be viewed in the
<htmlurl name="Release Notes" url="RELNOTES.html">.
]]>

X11R&relvers; and X11R&modvers; are being released at the same time to
assist in the transition from the older monolithic source tree to the
new modular source tree.  It will take time for everyone to make this
transition, so we will maintain the older X11R&majorvers; series through
update releases to both X11R&relvers; and X11R&prevrelvers;.

Most modern PC video hardware is supported in both releases, and most PC
video hardware that isn't supported explicitly can be used with the
"vesa" driver.  The <htmlurl name="Release Notes" url="RELNOTES3.html">
has a table showing the drivers provided with X11R&relvers; and
X11R&modvers;, and links to related documentation.

The X.Org Foundation X releases are produced by the X.Org Foundation.
The X.Org Foundation has been formed as a Delaware corporation organized
to operate as a scientific charity under IRS code 501(c)(3) chartered
to develop and execute effective strategies which provide world-wide
stewardship of the X Window System technology and standards. Membership
in the X.Org Foundation is free to all participants. Applications for
Membership are now being accepted, and active participants in the
further development of the X Window Technology are invited to complete a
<url url="http://www.x.org/XOrg_Foundation_Membership.html"
name="membership application">.  The X11R&relvers; and X11R&modvers;
codebase forms the fourth X Window System release since the formation of
the X.Org Foundation and includes code from the X Consortium, the Open
Group and the XFree86&trade; project.  This release is dedicated to the
greater X community, developers and users alike.

<sect>Licensing
<p>
X Window System source code is covered by many licenses.  All of these
licenses have in common the fact that they do not impose significant
conditions on the modification or redistribution or either source code
or binaries beyond requiring one or more of the following:

<enum>
<item>Copyright and/or license notices are left intact.
<item>Copyright and/or license notices are reproduced verbatim in

<sect>How to get the release
<p>
<![ %snapshot; [
X11R&relvers; can be found from the <url name="X.Org Foundation wiki at"
url="http://wiki.x.org">, and at
mirrors of this server.
]]>

<![ %release; [
Information about X11R&relvers; and X11R&modvers; can be found from the
<url name="X.Org Foundation wiki at" url="http://wiki.x.org">, and at
mirrors of this server.  Information about obtaining and installing
binary distributions of this release can be found in the <htmlurl
name="Installation Document" url="Install.html">.

Note that both X11R&relvers; and X11R&modvers; are being released
simultaneously but only one source tree is required to build the
release.  Information about obtaining the release in source form is
given below.
]]>

<sect1>X11R&relvers;
<p>
<![ %updaterel; [
The source for version &relvers; is available as a patch relative to
&prevrelvers;.
The patch file is <tt>&prevrelvers;-&relvers;.diff.gz</tt>.

The patch should be applied to a clean &prevrelvers; source tree,
working from the directory containing the <tt>xc/</tt> directory.  The
patch should be applied by running:

<tscreen><verb>
gzip -d &lt; &prevrelvers;-&relvers;.diff.gz | patch -p0 -E
</verb></tscreen>

Information about getting the source for &prevrelvers can be found in the
README file for that version, which can be found on the
<url name="X.Org foundation wiki" url="http://wiki.x.org">.
]]>

<![ %fullrel [

The source for version &fullrelvers; is available as a single tarball:

<tscreen><verb>
X11R&fullrelvers;-src.tar.gz
</verb></tscreen>

and also is available split into seven separate tarballs:

<tscreen><verb>
X11R&fullrelvers;-src1.tar.gz
X11R&fullrelvers;-src2.tar.gz
X11R&fullrelvers;-src3.tar.gz
X11R&fullrelvers;-src4.tar.gz
X11R&fullrelvers;-src5.tar.gz
X11R&fullrelvers;-src6.tar.gz
X11R&fullrelvers;-src7.tar.gz
</verb></tscreen>

The first three of the separate tarballs contain everything except the
fonts and general X11 documentation.  Those three are sufficient for
building X11R&relvers; if you already have a set of fonts.  The fourth
and fifth contain the fonts.  The sixth contains the source for the
general X11 documentation.  The seventh contains the general X11
documentation in hardcopy format.

<sect1>X11R&modvers;
<p>
This is the first release of the new modular source code tree.  The
souce code has been split into nine logical modules: app, data, doc,
driver, font, lib. proto, util and xserver.  Each of these modules
contain one or more packages that can be configured, built and installed
separately.  Please see an X11R&modvers; release site for a complete
list of the tarballs.

For information on how to build the modular tree packages see the <url
name="Modular Developer's Guide"
url="http://wiki.x.org/wiki/ModularDevelopersGuide">.  This guide also
contains information for developers who want to help improve the modular
build system and modular code base.

<sect1>The current development tree
<p>
The X source code for this and all releases/snapshots as well as
development versions can also be accessed via the Freedesktop.org CVS
repository.  It's also possible to browse the <url name="freedesktop CVS
repository" url="http://cvs.freedesktop.org/xorg/">.  The CVS tag for
the &relvers; version is "&reltag;" and the CVS tag for the &modvers;
version is "&modtag;".
<![ %notsnapshot [
The CVS tag for the stable branch for the %relvers; release is
"&relbranchtag;".
]]>

To check out the latest development version, don't specify any tag.


<sect>Reporting Bugs
<p>
Bugs should be reported to <url name="bug tracking system"
url="https://bugs.freedesktop.org/"> using the xorg component.  Before
reporting bugs, please check the server log file, which can be found at
<tt>/var/log/Xorg.0.log</tt> on most platforms.  If you can't resolve
the problem yourself, send the entire log file with your bug report but
not the operating system core dump.  Do not edit the log file as our
developers use it to reproduce and debug your problem.  Please attach it
to your bug report.
