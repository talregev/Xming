     How to install the X.Org Foundation's X Window System release ver-
     sion X11R6.9.

1.  Introduction

At this time, the X.Org Foundation is not making binary releases; this will
likely change in the future as our tinderbox system reaches its full poten-
tial.

However, people are already packaging the distribution for release in many of
the common distributions (e.g., Fedora Core, SuSE Linux, Debian), and you may
wish to work with those distributors on their packaged binaries.

In the meanwhile, we recommend building X from source and doing an install on
top of your running X installation *after* having carefully backed up
/usr/X11R6 to allow restoration in case of some unanticipated problems.  See
the file INSTALL.TXT in the root of the source distribution for build and
install details.
